# Calculator
Simple Calculator application made using Java, JavaFX

This Calculator is an imitation of a basic calculator (i.e. Calculator app on iPhone/Mac).
It will calculate one operation by one, meaning it will not look at the whole equation and solve using PEMDAS.
(branch ReadEntireEquation was originally designed to take in the entire equation and use PEMDAS but it was too sophisticated for the purpose of class assignment. Thus, it was not continued.)

It has a user interface (similar to Calculator app) with a text bar at the top indicating current operation and result and below it has buttons for numbers and operations.

Standard use case would be to press a number button, press an operation button, press another number button(s), and press '=' button.

It has been further updated to support multiple operations meaning the user can repeat the process of pressing number button and an operation button as desired.
(sums/products/quotients/differences will show on the text bar as the user continues the calculation).
